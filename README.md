# Github_ASFI_Research
### Documents
##### data_analysis.ipynb -> get more fork data from github api
##### graduated_clean.ipynb -> old notebook to get status of incubator projects
### Challenges
##### No way to construct fork graph from raw ASFI data
##### The few SVN projects are in completely different format
### Next Steps
##### Fix rate limiting of GitHub API
##### Find studyable features of forked branches
##### Locate additional data as necessary (Current dataset is thin on fork-related insight)
### Dataset
##### I loaded it onto the shared Google Drive
